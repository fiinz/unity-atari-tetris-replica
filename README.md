# Tetris
This project is a replica of the classic Tetris game, originally developed by Atari, created using Unity. The goal was to recreate the core gameplay mechanics and visual style of the original Tetris while leveraging Unity's powerful game development features. The game includes all the basic elements: falling blocks (tetrominoes), line clearing, and increasing difficulty as the player progresses.

The implementation follows the original Tetris resolution, visuals and the way the tetrominoes were formed in the Atari's version. The pieces were designed with the same appearance and graphic style as the original. 

### Features:
- Classic Tetris gameplay with falling blocks and line clearing
- Increasing difficulty as the game progresses
- Simple, retro-inspired graphics to match the Atari version
- Responsive controls and smooth gameplay

This project serves as a fun exercise in replicating a timeless arcade game and demonstrates my understanding of game mechanics, programming in C#, and Unity's interface.
